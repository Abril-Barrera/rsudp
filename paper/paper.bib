    abstract 	= "{Seismologists have recently begun using low‐cost nodal sensors in dense deployments to sample the seismic wavefield at unprecedented spatial resolution. Earthquake early warning systems and other monitoring networks (e.g., wastewater injection) would also benefit from network densification; however, current nodal sensors lack power systems or the real‐time data transmission required for these applications. A candidate sensor for these networks may instead be a low‐cost, all‐in‐one package such as the OSOP Raspberry Shake 4D (RS‐4D). The RS‐4D includes a vertical‐component geophone, three‐component accelerometer, digitizer, and near‐real‐time miniSEED data transmission and costs only a few hundred dollars per unit. Here, we step through instrument testing of three RS‐4Ds at the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL). We find that the geophones have sensitivities constrained to within 4\\% of nominal, but that they have relatively high self‐noise levels compared with the broadband sensors typically used in seismic networks. To demonstrate the impact this would have on characterizing nearby events, we estimate local magnitudes of earthquakes in Oklahoma using Trillium Compact broadband sensor data from U.S. Geological Survey aftershock deployments as well as 23 Raspberry Shakes operated by hobbyists and private owners within the state. We find that for ML 2.0–4.0 earthquakes at distances of 20–100 km from seismic stations, the Raspberry Shakes require events of magnitude ∼0.3 larger than the broadband sensors to reliably estimate ML at a given distance from the epicenter. We conclude that RS‐4Ds are suitable for densifying backbone networks designed for studies of local and regional events.}",

    abstract 	= "{The Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS) monitors seismicity throughout the state of Oklahoma utilizing permanent and temporary seismometers installed by OGS and other agencies, while producing a real‐time earthquake catalog. The OGS seismic network was recently added to the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) as a self‐supporting regional seismic network, and earthquake locations and magnitudes are automatically reported through U.S. Geological Survey and are part of the ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog. In Oklahoma, before 2009, background seismicity rates were about 2 M 3.0+ earthquakes per year, which increased to 579 and 903 M 3.0+ earthquakes in 2014 and 2015, respectively. After seismicity peaked, the rate fell to 624, 304, and 194 M 3.0+ earthquakes in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. The catalog is complete down to M 2.2 from mid‐2014 to present, despite the significant workload for a primarily state‐funded regional network. That astonishing uptick in seismicity has been largely attributed to wastewater injection practices. The OGS provides the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the agency responsible for regulating oil and gas activities within the state, with technical guidance and earthquake products that inform their “traffic‐light” mitigation protocol and other mitigating actions. We have initiated a citizen‐scientist‐driven, educational seismometer program by installing Raspberry Shake geophones throughout the state at local schools, museums, libraries, and state parks. The seismic hazard of the state portends a continued need for expansion and densification of seismic monitoring throughout Oklahoma.}",

	ABSTRACT={The high degree of human activities in urban environments produces large background vibrations that makes it difficult to use data acquired in these areas for classical seismology. Seismometers installed within cities have been typically been used for the study of seismic hazard or for monitoring civil engineering problems. However, with the development of monitoring techniques based on the interpretation of the so-called seismic ambient noise, these data have gained scientific interest. Our objective is to discuss an additional utility of seismometers deployed within a city; its use as a tool to connect society with Earth sciences. Many citizen activities, from traffic to music concerts, produce vibrations that can be recorded seismically, and our experience shows that these records attract the attention of the media and social networks. With the emergence of low-cost and easy-to-use instruments in recent years, more citizens can now record ground motion and become interested in the interpretation of the recorded seismograms. The installation of permanent seismic networks in educational centers has proven to be a good approach to introduce students to Earth sciences at the national level and can also be developed at the urban scale using this new instrumentation. In this contribution we will first review the previous results related to the identification of the sources of vibration in urban areas and then present a new ongoing project based on the deployment of a seismic network in educational centers located in the city of Barcelona.}

	ABSTRACT	= {Nepal, located above the convergent India-Eurasia plate boundary, has repeatedly experienced devastating earthquakes. During the 2015 magnitude 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, an often-reported experience was that people were not aware of the threatening seismic hazard and had an insufficient level of preparedness. An important source of the problem is that earthquake-related topics are not part of the school curriculum. Earthquake education reaching a broad group of the population early in their lives is therefore strongly needed. We established an initiative in Nepal to introduce seismology in schools, with a focus on education and citizen seismology. We have prepared educational materials adapted to the Nepali school system, which we distributed and also share on our program’s website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://seismoschoolnp.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://seismoschoolnp.org</ext-link>. In selected schools, we also installed a low-cost seismometer to record seismicity and to allow learning-by-doing classroom activities. Our approach was very well received and we hope it will help make earthquake-safe communities across Nepal. The seismic sensor which we installed in schools is a Raspberry Shake 1D (RS1D), this was selected based on its performance in laboratory tests and suitability for the field conditions. At a test site in Switzerland we were able to record magnitude 1.0 events up to 50 km distance with a RS1D. In Nepal, 22 such seismometers installed in schools create the Nepal School Seismology Network providing online data openly. The seismometer in each school allows students to be informed of earthquakes, visualize the respective waveforms, and estimate the distance and magnitude of the event. For significant local and regional events, we provide record sections and network instrumental intensity maps on our program’s website. In 6 months of network operation, more than 194 local and teleseismic earthquakes of M ≥ 4 have been recorded. From a local and a global catalog, complemented with our own visual identifications, we have provided an earthquake wave detectability graph in distance and magnitude domain. Based on our observations, we have calibrated a new magnitude equation for Nepal, related to the epicentral distance D [km] and to the observed peak vertical ground velocity PGV<sub>V</sub> [μm/s]. The calibration is done to best fit local catalog magnitudes, and yields the following equation: M = 1.05 × log<sub>10</sub>(PGV<sub>V</sub>) + 1.08 × log<sub>10</sub>(D) + 0.75.}

	abstract 	= {Data acquisition by seismic centers relies on real-time systems, like SeisComP3, Antelope and Earthworm. However, these are complex systems that are designed for fast and precisely defined standard real-time analyses. Therefore, it is not a simple task to access or modify internal routines, and to integrate them into custom-processing workflows or to perform in-depth data analyses. Often a library is necessary that provides convenient access to data and allows easy control over all of the operations that are to be performed on the data. ObsPy is such a library, which is designed to access and process seismological waveform data and metadata. We use short and simple examples here to demonstrate how effective it is to use Python for seismological data analysis. Then, we illustrate the general capabilities of ObsPy, and highlight some of its specific aspects that are relevant for seismological data centers and observatories, through presentation of real-world examples. Finally, we demonstrate how the ObsPy library can be used to develop custom graphical user interface applications.},

	abstract 	= {The Python libraries NumPy and SciPy are extremely powerful tools for numerical processing and analysis well suited to a large variety of applications. We developed ObsPy (http://obspy.org), a Python library for seismology intended to facilitate the development of seismological software packages and workflows, to utilize these abilities and provide a bridge for seismology into the larger scientific Python ecosystem. Scientists in many domains who wish to convert their existing tools and applications to take advantage of a platform like the one Python provides are confronted with several hurdles such as special file formats, unknown terminology, and no suitable replacement for a non-trivial piece of software. We present an approach to implement a domain-specific time series library on top of the scientific NumPy stack. In so doing, we show a realization of an abstract internal representation of time series data permitting I/O support for a diverse collection of file formats. Then we detail the integration and repurposing of well established legacy codes, enabling them to be used in modern workflows composed in Python. Finally we present a case study on how to integrate research code into ObsPy, opening it to the broader community. While the implementations presented in this work are specific to seismology, many of the described concepts and abstractions are directly applicable to other sciences, especially to those with an emphasis on time series analysis.}
