Program architecture and flow
#################################################

rsudp is laid out in a way that is standard for many continuous monitoring
softwares, but which may be unfamiliar to some developers.

The program's organization relies on two hierarchies: thread hierarchy and
data hierarchy. This allows the program to distribute data and messages
between different modules efficiently while maintaining programmatic
integrity required by rsudp's dependencies (:py:mod:`matplotlib.pyplot`
objects, for example, can only be owned by the master thread).

    Data and (inset) thread hierarchies for rsudp.
    This figure shows a flow chart of data as it makes its way through
    rsudp's producer-consumer architecture,
    and eventually to the end-consumer processing the data.
    Thread hierarchies are shown in the inset chart.
    If you are looking to add a module to rsudp,
    it will be a worker class (red) and will receive data from
    the master consumer like the rest of the workers.


Thread layout
*************************************************

The program relies on the :py:mod:`threading` and :py:mod:`queue` modules
to spin up multiple threads which all receive and work with data
independently of one another.

First, the :py:mod:`rsudp.client` (the "main" or "parent" thread) gathers
and parses settings. The client then instantiates the relevant
:py:class:`threading.Thread` objects as and passes settings and queues to
them. Next, it starts each of these consumer threads as "child" threads,
then finally the producer, also as a child thread.

If the :py:class:`rsudp.c_plot.Plot` thread is enabled, the program will
start that last, since plotting must be run as a loop controlled by the
main thread (:py:mod:`rsudp.client`) which can only be done once it has
started all of its child threads.


.. _producer-consumer:

Producer-consumer message passing
*************************************************

Data is read off the port by the data producer
(:py:class:`rsudp.p_producer.Producer`) and passed directly to the
(:py:class:`rsudp.c_consumer.Consumer`) via a first-in first-out (FIFO)
queue object.

This master consumer then duplicates these messages and
passes them to each sub-consumer queue destination in a list. At the
other end of each of these queues is a sub-consumer module, denoted
with a :py:data:`c_` before its module name.

Sub-consumers read messages from their queues and process data in
their logic loops. Some build :py:class:`obspy.core.stream.Stream` with
the data passed to them, while some ignore the data and watch for
status messages.

Message types
=================================================

.. versionadded:: 0.4.3 the :code:`RESET` message type was added.

Currently, the message types are as follows.

========= ==========================================
 Message              Format example
========= ==========================================
 data      ``b"{'EHZ', 1582315130.292, 14168, 14927, 16112, 17537, 18052, 17477, 15418, 13716, 15604, 17825, 19637, 20985, 17325, 10439, 11510, 17678, 20027, 20207, 18481, 15916, 13836, 13073, 14462, 17628, 19388}"``
 ALARM     ``b'ALARM 2020-02-23T06:56:40.598944Z'``
 RESET     ``b'RESET 2020-02-23T06:56:55.435214Z'``
 IMGPATH   ``b'IMGPATH 2020-02-23T06:59:19.211704Z /home/pi/rsudp/screenshots/R24FA-2020-02-23-065919.png'``
========= ==========================================

**ALARM** messages are sent by :py:class:`rsudp.p_producer.Producer`
when it sees the :py:data:`rsudp.c_consumer.Alert.alarm` flag set to
``True``. This can trigger all sorts of actions. For example, when the
:py:class:`rsudp.c_alertsound.AlertSound` module is enabled and sees
this message, it uses ffmpeg or libav to play a sound. The social media
classes :py:class:`rsudp.c_tweet.Tweeter` and
:py:class:`rsudp.c_telegram.Telegrammer` both use this message to
instantly broadcast to their respective platforms.

**RESET** messages are sent by :py:class:`rsudp.p_producer.Producer`
when it sees the :py:data:`rsudp.c_consumer.Alert.alarm` flag set to
``True``. Similar to ALARM messages, consumers can be programmed for
an essentially infinite number of things upon seeing this message.

**IMGPATH** messages are placed on the master queue by the
:py:func:`rsudp.c_plot.Plot.savefig` function, if and when a screenshot
figure is saved to disk. This is currently only used by the social media
modules, :py:class:`rsudp.c_tweet.Tweeter` and
:py:class:`rsudp.c_telegram.Telegrammer` which then send the saved image
to their respective social media platforms' APIs for broadcast.


.. _add_your_own:

Adding your own consumer modules
*************************************************

Adding consumer modules is easy in theory, when you understand the
workings of rsudp's layout. Using the existing modules' code architecture
is likely useful and should be encouraged, so feel free to follow along
with what we have already laid out in the code base.

Here is a sample consumer construction to modify for your own purposes:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from rsudp.raspberryshake import ConsumerThread
    from rsudp import printM

    class MyModule(ConsumerThread):
        '''
        Documentation of your new module class goes here.

        :param queue.Queue q: queue of data and messages sent by :class:`rsudp.c_consumer.Consumer`

        '''
        def __init__(self, q,    # more defaults to pass to the class
                    )
            super().__init__()
            self.sender = 'MyModule'
            self.alive = True
            self.queue = q
            # ... lots of other stuff to initialize your module
            printM('Ready.', sender=self.sender)

        def getq(self):
            '''
            Reads data from the queue and returns the queue object.

            :rtype: bytes
            :return: The queue object.
            '''
            d = self.queue.get()
            self.queue.task_done()
            return d

        def run(self):
            '''
            Documenting how my cool module works!
            '''
            printM('Starting.', sender=self.sender)
            # some stuff to execute here at runtime before looping

            while self.alive:
                # main loop, do something until self.alive == False
                d = self.getq()
                if 'TERM' in str(d):
                    self.alive = False

            # now exit
            printM('Exiting.', sender=self.sender)
            sys.exit()

This consumer is created from a
:py:class:`rsudp.raspberryshake.ConsumerThread` object,
which in turn modifies the :py:class:`threading.Thread` class.


.. _add_testing:

Testing your module
=================================================

Testing new modules is easy in rsudp.

The :py:func:`rsudp.client.test` function is set to run any enabled
module by default. If the module is not enabled in the default
settings, you can add a line to the
:py:func:`rsudp.test.make_test_settings` that specifies

.. code-block:: python

    settings['your_module']['enabled'] = True

The second step is to add your test to the dictionary of tests in
:py:mod:`rsudp.test`, so that it gets reported. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    TEST = {
            # other tests
            # ...
            'c_mytest':             ['something I am testing for  ', False],
            'c_anotherone':         ['some other thing I test     ', False],
    }

Each dictionary item is constructed as a two-item list,
where the first item is the description string,
and the second is the status of the test
(False is failure and True is passing).

Then, in your module, you can import the test dictionary and modify
the status of your tests like so:

.. code-block:: python

    from rsudp.raspberryshake import ConsumerThread
    from rsudp.test import TEST

    class MyModule(ConsumerThread):
        def __init__(self, q    # ...
                    )
            super().__init__()
            self.sender = 'MyModule'
            self.alive = True
            self.queue = q
            # ... lots of other stuff to initialize your module
            if abc:
                # this test occurs during initialization
                TEST['c_mytest'][1] = True

        def run(self):
            # some stuff here also
            if xyz:
                # this test is done at runtime
                TEST['c_anotherone'][1] = True
            while self.alive:
                # main loop, do something until self.alive == False
                # or you receive the TERM message
            # now exit
            printM('Exiting.', self.sender)
            sys.exit()
