| **Python tools for receiving and interacting with Raspberry Shake UDP data**
| *by Ian M. Nesbitt and Richard I. Boaz*

Welcome to rsudp's documentation.
This program was written to parse and process live UDP data streams from Raspberry Shake personal seismographs.
rsudp allows users the options to see their data in real time, create alert parameters,
and be notified in various ways when their instrument detects sudden motion.

| In order to get a feel for what rsudp can do, check out our :ref:`youtube` page.
| If you prefer to read in-depth documentation, follow our written :ref:`tutorial`.
