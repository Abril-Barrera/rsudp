| **Python tools for receiving and interacting with Raspberry Shake UDP data**
| *by Ian M. Nesbitt and Richard I. Boaz*

Welcome to rsudp's documentation.
This program was written to parse and process live UDP data streams from Raspberry Shake personal seismographs.
rsudp allows users the options to see their data in real time, create alert parameters,
and be notified in various ways when their instrument detects sudden motion.

The demands of real-time seismic processing, as in many types of scientific operations,
require that calculations must be made quickly and
remain stable for weeks or months without user intervention.
rsudp aims to achieve both of these things,
while maintaining a codebase lean enough to run on Raspberry Pi
but intuitive enough that users can learn the theory of
real time continuous data processing and contribute code of their own.
The project's source repository is `here <https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp>`_.

| In order to get a feel for what rsudp can do, check out our YouTube tutorials below.
